  summary: "Enterprise Power Platform & Dynamics 365 Solution Architect | Dataverse Data Architect | AI & Application Lifecycle Management Lead. I bridge the gap between complex business operations and enterprise-grade Microsoft Power Platform architecture. With 7+ years of service delivery and operations leadership, I bring a unique dual perspective: Dataverse-first data architecture with Business Units, Security Roles, and polymorphic lookups — not SharePoint as a production data store. SharePoint Online was used only as an interim cost-optimization staging layer during rapid migration, with a documented Dataverse Migration Blueprint as the enterprise-grade target."
